# 6-Stage-Pipelined-RISC-Processor
6 Stage Pipelined 16 bit RISC Processor(8 register) with 15 instructions includes load, strore instructions.Implemented major blocks including forwarding unit,branch prediction unit for optimizing performance.The 6 stages are Instruction	 fetch,	 instruction	 decode,	 register	
read,	 execute,	 memory	 access,	 and	 write	 back.
